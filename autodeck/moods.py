"""Moods: a set of songs built from what people put in public playlists on a theme.

"Balkan party" -> the top YouTube playlists for that search, each read in full; songs that
appear in several of them (also counted in Deezer playlists on the theme) rank first: they're
the crowd's picks, not one person's taste. YouTube entries already carry a video id, so the
winners import without another search. Network only; the engine stores and applies the result.
